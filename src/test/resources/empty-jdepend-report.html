        <h1>JDepend Metrics Report</h1>The following document contains the results of a <a
            href="https://github.com/clarkware/jdepend">JDepend</a> metric analysis. The various metrics are defined at the bottom of this
        document.<br /><br />

                    <td style="text-align: left;">The number of concrete and abstract classes (and interfaces) in the package is an
                        indicator of the extensibility of the package.</td>

                    <td style="text-align: left;">The number of incoming dependencies, i.e., other packages that depend upon classes within
                        the package. This is an indicator of the package's responsibility.</td>

                    <td style="text-align: left;">The number of outgoing dependencies, i.e., other packages that the classes in the package
                        depend upon. This is an indicator of the package's independence.</td>

                        the total number of classes in the analyzed package. The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with A=0 indicating a
                        completely concrete package and A=1 indicating a completely abstract package.</td>

                    <td style="text-align: left;">The ratio of efferent coupling (Ce) to total coupling (Ce / (Ce + Ca)). This metric is an
                        indicator of the package's resilience to change. The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with I=0 indicating a
                        completely stable package and I=1 indicating a completely instable package.</td>

                <tr class="a">
                    <td style="text-align: left;">Distance (D)</td>
                    <td style="text-align: left;">The perpendicular distance of a package from the idealized line A + I = 1. This metric is
                        an indicator of the package's balance between abstractness and stability. A package squarely on the main sequence is
                        optimally balanced with respect to its abstractness and stability. Ideal packages are either completely abstract and
                        stable (x=0, y=1) or completely concrete and instable (x=1, y=0). The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with D=0
                        indicating a package that is coincident with the main sequence and D=1 indicating a package that is as far from the
                        main sequence as possible.</td>

                <tr class="b">
                    <td style="text-align: left;">Cycles</td>
                    <td style="text-align: left;">Packages participating in a package dependency cycle are in a deadly embrace with respect
                        to reusability and their release cycle. Package dependency cycles can be easily identified by reviewing the textual
                        reports of dependency cycles. Once these dependency cycles have been identified with JDepend, they can be broken by
                        employing various object-oriented techniques.</td>

                    <td style="text-align: left;">Package Info</td>
                    <td style="text-align: left;">A flag showing if there is a package-info class in the package. This is useful for
                        package-level documentation, as well as being a home for package-level annotations.</td>
